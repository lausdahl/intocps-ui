A new UI for the INTO-CPS application. 

How to build

The app is built with Electron and Node.js. You need
npm (comes with Node.js). We use Gulp to manage tasks. Its easiest to 
have it installed globally (`npm install -g gulp`).

After checking out the repo...
1. To install dependencies: `npm intall`
2. To build the UI: `gulp`
3. To run it: `npm start`
