intocps-ui
---
A new UI for the INTO-CPS application. 


How to build
---
The app is built with Electron and Node.js. You need
npm (comes with Node.js). We use Gulp to manag etasks. Its easiest to 
have it installed globally (`npm install -g gulp`). 

After checking out the repo...

1. To install node dependencies: `npm install`
3. To install other resources: `gulp init`
4. To build the UI: `gulp`
5. To run it: `npm start`

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice. It's cross-platform and is actually built on top of Electron. That said, you can use whatever you want.
