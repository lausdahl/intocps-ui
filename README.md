intocps-ui
---
A new UI for the INTO-CPS application. 

How to build
---
The app is built with Electron and Node.js. You need
npm (comes with Node.js). We use Gulp to manage tasks. Its easiest to 
have it installed globally (`npm install -g gulp`). 

After checking out the repo...

1. To install dependencies: `npm install`
2. To install gulp: `npm install -g gulp`
3. To initialize: `gulp init`
4. To build the UI: `gulp`
5. To run it: `npm start`

Editor

Visual Studio Code works well, it is cross-platform and actually built on top of Electron.
